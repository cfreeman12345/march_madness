Takes the picks of each person in the family bracket pool and the real winners of each game and computes the number of points each person currently has and the maximum possible points for each player.  Also runs 100000 simulations for the rest of the bracket (assuming each game is a coin flip), and computes the probability that each person wins the bracket pool.
